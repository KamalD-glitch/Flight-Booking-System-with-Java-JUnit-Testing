# Flight Booking System with Java & JUnit Testing

## Overview

This project implements a Flight Booking System using Java, demonstrating key object-oriented programming concepts such as:

- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Composition
- Static and Instance Variables
- Abstract Classes

The system supports booking flights, issuing tickets, and applying discounts for different passenger types. Comprehensive testing is conducted using JUnit to ensure robustness.
